A simple emulator for the Chip-8 Programming Language 
by Dongie Agnir

This is an almost complete emulator for the Chip-8 Programming language that 
was developed in the 1970's.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-8 for 
more information.

Things that don't work:
-The sound timer works, but no sound plays when it finishes.

Limitations:
-The emulator assumes that the Chip-8 ROM starts at 200h.  It is my 
understanding that some games/programs may start at 600h but I have not
encountered those yet, and the emulator does not account for them.
-Does not (yet) support programs written for Super Chip.

This project was developed in a Windows environment and compiled with MinGW.
However, the project itself is completely written in ANSI C/C89 and only relies
on SDL, which is available for most major operating systems.

Building on Windows:

First you need to gather some of the requirements:
-MinGW (the project was developed with GCC 4.7)
        -When installing, make sure that you check the option to add MinGW to
        your PATH.
-CMake

The project also depends on SDL, but version 1.2 is already included with the
project under /dep.  

1. Once you have MinGW and CMake installed, create a folder where the compiled
project will go.  
2. Launch CMake 
3. Click browse source, and point it to [The Chip-8 Project Directory]\src
4. Click browse build and point it to the directory you created in step 1
5. Click 'Generate'
6. Open a command prompt (Run->'cmd')
7. cd to your build directory
8. type mingw32-make
9. You're done, the emulator is called chip8emulator.exe and will be found in
[Build Directory]\chip8emu
10. See the note below if you don't have SDL.dll in your PATH

*NOTE*:
You must have the SDL.dll in your PATH.  If you don't, either add it, or 
copy the included SDL.dll from [Chip 8 Project directory]\dep\SDL\bin to 
[Build Directory]\chip8emu

Using:
Simply drag a Chip-8 Binary (you can google for them) on to the emulator 
executable.  

The keyboard layout is as follows:
1 2 3 4
Q W E R
A S D F
Z X C V

For more information see the documentation upon which this emulator is based
